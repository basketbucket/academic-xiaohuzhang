Series FACTS devices, such as a Variable Series Reactor (VSR), have the ability to
continuously regulate the transmission line reactance so as to control power flow. This
research work evaluates the benefits brought by VSRs in different aspects of power
system and develops efficient planning models and algorithms to provide optimal
investment plan for the VSRs.
