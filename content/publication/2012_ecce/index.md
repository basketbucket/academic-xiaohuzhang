# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "An ultra-wide-area transmission network emulator represented by regenerative converters is developed in this paper. The converters are paralleled to provide and share power similar to electromechanical generators. Others are controlled to emulate loads, such as, induction motors and constant impedance, current, power (ZIP) loads. The structure and control algorithms of these power system component emulators are discussed in detail, and the performance of overall system architecture is presented. As is well-known, the induction motor will induce large power perturbation when it starts. The simulation results clearly show the dynamic response and starting up process of the load."
