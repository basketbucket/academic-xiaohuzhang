abstract = "A Hardware Test-Bed (HTB) is developed to serve as a platform for power grid emulation. For maximum flexibility, power converters, which can accommodate various control algorithms and behave distinctively based on the applied model and control, is adopted. With the developed emulators, such as generator, load, wind turbine, and PV emulators, diverse research and experiments can be performed by using the HTB. This paper introduces the emulating method, hardware, control and communication structure of the HTB. At the same time, experimental results are compared with simulation to verify the emulation."
