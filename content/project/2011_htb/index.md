Transmission network emulator, also called Hardware Test-Bed (HTB), is conceptualized to
emulate the large scale power system by interconnected converters which emulate power
generators and loads. With modular and reconfigurable converters, the HTB can have flexible
network and perform various scenario emulations. The HTB will allow testing, integration and
demonstration of various key technologies on monitoring, control, actuation, and visualization.
